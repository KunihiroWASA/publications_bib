abstract="In this paper, we address the problem of enumerating all induced subtrees in an input {\$}{\$}k{\$}{\$}-degenerate graph, where an induced subtree is an acyclic and connected induced subgraph. A graph {\$}{\$}G = (V, E){\$}{\$}is a {\$}{\$}k{\$}{\$}-degenerate graph if for any its induced subgraph has a vertex whose degree is less than or equal to {\$}{\$}k{\$}{\$}, and many real-world graphs have small degeneracies, or very close to small degeneracies. Although, the studies are on subgraphs enumeration, such as trees, paths, and matchings, but the problem addresses the subgraph enumeration, such as enumeration of subgraphs that are trees. Their induced subgraph versions have not been studied well. One of few examples is for chordless paths and cycles. Our motivation is to reduce the time complexity close to {\$}{\$}O(1){\$}{\$}for each solution. This type of optimal algorithms is proposed many subgraph classes such as trees, and spanning trees. Induced subtrees are fundamental object thus it should be studied deeply and there possibly exist some efficient algorithms. Our algorithm utilizes nice properties of {\$}{\$}k{\$}{\$}-degeneracy to state an effective amortized analysis. As a result, the time complexity is reduced to {\$}{\$}O(k){\$}{\$}time per induced subtree. The problem is solved in constant time for each in planar graphs, as a corollary.",

abstract="In this paper, we study the problem of finding all tree-like substructure contained in a hypergraph, with potential applications to substructure mining from relational data. We employ the class of connected and Berge acyclic sub-hypergraphs as definition of tree-like substructures, which is the most restricted notion of acyclicities for hypergraphs. Then, we present an efficient depth-first algorithm that finds all connected and Berge acyclic sub-hypergraphs S in a hypergraph {\$}{\backslash}mathcal H{\$}with m hyperedges and n vertices in O(nm2) time per solution (delay) using O(N) space, where {\$}N = ||{\backslash}mathcal H||{\$}is the total input size. To achieve efficient enumeration, we use the notion of the maximum border set. This result gives the first polynomial delay and time algorithm for enumeration of connected and Berge-acyclic sub-hypergraphs. We also present an incremental enumeration algorithm that finds all solutions S in {\$}O({\backslash}varDelta MB(S){\backslash}tau(m)) = O(rd{\backslash}cdot{\backslash}tau(m)){\$}delay using O(N) space and preprocessing, whose delay depends only on the difference of solutions, where S is the enumerated sub-hypergraph, {\$}{\backslash}varDelta MB(S){\$}is the number of newly added hyperedges to the maximum border of S, r and d are the rank and degree of {\$}{\backslash}mathcal H{\$}, respectively, and $\tau$(m) = ((log log m)2/log log log m).",

abstract  ="In this paper, we study efficient computation of tree similarity for ordered trees based on compressed subtree enumeration. The compressed subtree enumeration is a new paradigm of enumeration algorithms that enumerates all subtrees of an input tree T in the form of their compressed bit signatures. For the task of enumerating all compressed bit signatures of k-subtrees in an ordered tree T, we first present an enumeration algorithm in O(k)-delay, and then, present another enumeration algorithm in constant-delay using O(n) time preprocessing that directly outputs bit signatures. These algorithms are designed based on bit-parallel speed-up technique for signature maintenance. By experiments on real and artificial datasets, both algorithms showed approximately 22{\%} to 36{\%} speed-up over the algorithms without bit-parallel signature maintenance.",

Based on reverse search technique, we present the first constant delay enumeration algorithm that lists all k-subtrees of an input tree in O(1) worst-case time per subtree. This result improves on the straightforward application of Ferreira et al's algorithm with O(k) amortized time per subtree when an input is restricted to tree.
