    abstract  = "A ladder lottery of a permutation $\pi = (p_1, p_2, \dots , p_n)$ is a network with $n$ vertical lines and zero or more horizontal lines each of which connects exactly two consecutive vertical lines. The top ends and the bottom ends of the vertical lines correspond to the identity permutation and $\pi$, respectively. Each horizontal line corresponds to an intersection of two vertical lines. Suppose that we are given a permutation $\pi$ of $[n] = \{1, 2, \dots, n\}$ and a multi-set $S$ of intersections each of which is a pair of elements in $[n]$. Then Ladder-Lottery Realization problem asks whether or not there is a ladder-lottery of $π$ in which each intersection in $S$ appears exactly once. We show that Ladder-Lottery Realization problem is NP-complete. We also present some positive results of Ladder-Lottery Realization and its variant.",

    abstract  = "The girth of a graph is the length of its shortest cycle. Due to its relevance in graph theory, network analysis and practical fields such as distributed computing, girth-related problems have been object of attention in both past and recent literature. In this paper, we consider the problem of listing connected subgraphs with bounded girth. As a large girth is index of sparsity, this allows to extract sparse structures from the input graph. We propose two algorithms, for enumerating respectively vertex induced subgraphs and edge induced subgraphs with bounded girth, both running in O(n) amortized time per solution and using {\$}{\$}O(n^3){\$}{\$}space. Furthermore, the algorithms can be easily adapted to relax the connectivity requirement and to deal with weighted graphs. As a byproduct, the second algorithm can be used to answer the well known question of finding the densest n-vertex graph(s) of girth k.",

    abstract  = "Subgraph enumeration problems ask to output all subgraphs of an input graph that belong to a specified graph class or satisfy a given constraint. These problems have been widely studied in theoretical computer science. So far, many efficient enumeration algorithms for the fundamental substructures such as spanning trees, cycles, and paths, have been developed. This paper addresses the enumeration problem of bipartite subgraphs. Even though bipartite graphs are quite fundamental and have numerous applications in both theory and practice, their enumeration algorithms have not been intensively studied, to the best of our knowledge. We propose the first non-trivial algorithms for enumerating all bipartite subgraphs in a given graph. As the main results, we develop two efficient algorithms: the one enumerates all bipartite induced subgraphs of a graph with degeneracy k in {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathcal {\{}O{\}}{\backslash}left( k{\backslash}right) {\$}{\$}time per solution.
