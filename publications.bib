abstract  ="In this paper, we study efficient computation of tree similarity for ordered trees based on compressed subtree enumeration. The compressed subtree enumeration is a new paradigm of enumeration algorithms that enumerates all subtrees of an input tree T in the form of their compressed bit signatures. For the task of enumerating all compressed bit signatures of k-subtrees in an ordered tree T, we first present an enumeration algorithm in O(k)-delay, and then, present another enumeration algorithm in constant-delay using O(n) time preprocessing that directly outputs bit signatures. These algorithms are designed based on bit-parallel speed-up technique for signature maintenance. By experiments on real and artificial datasets, both algorithms showed approximately 22{\%} to 36{\%} speed-up over the algorithms without bit-parallel signature maintenance.",

    abstract   ="By the motivation to discover patterns in massive structured data in the form of graphs and trees, we study a special case of the ksubtree enumeration problem, originally introduced by (Ferreira, Grossi, and Rizzi, ESA'11, 275-286, 2011), where an input graph is a tree of n nodes. Based on reverse search technique, we present the first constant delay enumeration algorithm that lists all k-subtrees of an input tree in O(1) worst-case time per subtree. This result improves on the straightforward application of Ferreira et al's algorithm with O(k) amortized time per subtree when an input is restricted to tree. Finally, we discuss an application of our algorithm to a modification of the graph motif problem for trees.",
