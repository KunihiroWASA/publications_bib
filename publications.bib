We prove that the enumeration of all (inclusion-minimal) induced Steiner subgraphs is harder than the well-known Hypergraph Transversal enumeration problem if the number of terminals is not fixed. When the number of terminals is fixed, we propose a polynomial delay algorithm for listing all induced Steiner subgraphs of minimum size.

We first prove that the problem is PSPACE-complete even for split graphs and for bipartite graphs of bounded bandwidth with maximum degree five. We then investigate polynomial-time solvable cases. Specifically, we prove that the problem is solvable in polynomial time for strongly orderable graphs (that include interval graphs and strongly chordal graphs), for outerplanar graphs, and for cographs (also known as P_4-free graphs).

Enumeration of minimal dominating sets in a graph is one of central problems in enumeration study since enumeration of minimal dominating sets corresponds to enumeration of minimal hypergraph transversal. However, enumeration of dominating sets including non-minimal ones has not been received much attention. In this paper, we address enumeration problems for dominating sets from sparse graphs which are degenerate graphs and graphs with large girth, and we propose two algorithms for solving the problems. The first algorithm enumerates all the dominating sets for a k-degenerate graph in O(k) time per solution using O(n + m) space, where n and m are respectively the number of vertices and edges in an input graph. That is, the algorithm is optimal for graphs with constant degeneracy such as trees, planar graphs, H-minor free graphs with some fixed H. The second algorithm enumerates all the dominating sets in constant time per solution for input graphs with girth at least nine.",

A graph G is k-degenerate if each of its induced subgraphs has a vertex of degree at most k. The degeneracy is considered as an indicator of the sparseness of the graph. Real-world graphs such as road networks, social networks and internet networks often have small degeneracy. Compared to other kinds of graph classes, bounded degeneracy does not give many structural properties such as induced subgraph free, or minor free. From this, using bounded degeneracy to reduce the time complexity is often not trivial.

In domains that model networks as undirected graphs, communities are generally associated with dense subgraphs, and many community models have been proposed. Maximal cliques are arguably the most widely studied among such models, with early works dating back to the '60s, and a continuous stream of research up to the present. In domains that model networks as directed graphs, several approaches for community detection have been proposed, but there seems to be no clear model of cohesive subgraph, i.e., of what a community should look like. We extend the fundamental model of clique to directed graphs, adding the natural constraint of strong connectivity within the clique. We characterize the problem by giving a tight bound for the number of such cliques in a graph, and highlighting useful structural properties. We then exploit these properties to produce the first algorithm with polynomial delay for enumerating maximal strongly connected cliques.",

Their induced subgraph versions have not been studied well. One of few examples is for chordless paths and cycles. Our motivation is to reduce the time complexity close to {\$}{\$}O(1){\$}{\$}for each solution. This type of optimal algorithms is proposed many subgraph classes such as trees, and spanning trees.

We employ the class of connected and Berge acyclic sub-hypergraphs as definition of tree-like substructures, which is the most restricted notion of acyclicities for hypergraphs. Then, we present an efficient depth-first algorithm that finds all connected and Berge acyclic sub-hypergraphs S in a hypergraph {\$}{\backslash}mathcal H{\$}with m hyperedges and n vertices in O(nm2) time per solution (delay) using O(N) space, where {\$}N = ||{\backslash}mathcal H||{\$}is the total input size.

For the task of enumerating all compressed bit signatures of k-subtrees in an ordered tree T, we first present an enumeration algorithm in O(k)-delay, and then, present another enumeration algorithm in constant-delay using O(n) time preprocessing that directly outputs bit signatures. These algorithms are designed based on bit-parallel speed-up technique for signature maintenance. By experiments on real and artificial datasets, both algorithms showed approximately 22{\%} to 36{\%} speed-up over the algorithms without bit-parallel signature maintenance.",

Degeneracy is a well known sparsity measure, and k-degenerate subgraphs are a notion of sparse subgraphs, which generalizes other problems such as independent sets (0-degenerate subgraphs) and forests (1-degenerate subgraphs). Many efficient enumeration algorithms are designed by solving the so-called Extension problem, which asks whether there exists a maximal solution containing a given set of nodes, but no node from a forbidden set. We show that solving this problem is np-complete for maximal k-degenerate induced subgraphs, motivating the need for additional techniques."

    abstract = {In this study, we address a problem pertaining to the induced matching enumeration. An edge set M is an induced matching of a graph G=(V,E). The enumeration of matchings has been widely studied in literature; however, there few studies on induced matching. A straightforward algorithm takes O(Δ2) time for each solution that is coming from the time to generate a subproblem, where Δ is the maximum degree in an input graph. To generate a subproblem, an algorithm picks up an edge e and generates two graphs, the one is obtained by removing e from G, the other is obtained by removing e, adjacent edge to e, and edges adjacent to adjacent edge of e. Since this operation needs O(Δ2) time, a straightforward algorithm enumerates all induced matchings in O(Δ2) time per solution. We investigated local structures that enable us to generate subproblems within a short time and proved that the time complexity will be O(1) if the input graph is C4-free. A graph is C4-free if and only if none of its subgraphs have a cycle of length four.}
